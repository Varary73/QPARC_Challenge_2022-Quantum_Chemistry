## Project Description:
The idea was to perform the VQE calculation on the monomers of one of the Lieb lattice. The monomer size was too large so we went with units of the monomers themselves. Benzene makes up for most of the lattice and there is the small ‘isopropyl cyanide’ (which is names nitrile). We would run the optimization and single point on these molecules and then run the single point on the reported structure of the Lieb lattice, following which we compute the binding energy.
